## Go-noGo task
     
Equiprobable Go/NoGo learning task (i.e. the ratio Go cues: NoGo cues is 50:50) featuring Win cues (chance for winning points/ money vs. neutral outcome) and Avoid cues (chance for neutral outcome vs. losing points/money).
The task features 4 conditions (at least 1 cue per condition):
- Go-to-Win: Cue with chance for winning money, requires Go response
- Go-to-Avoid: Cue with chance for losing money, requires Go response
- NoGo-to-Win: Cue with chance for winning money, requires NoGo response
- NoGo-to-Avoid: Cue with chance for losing money, requires NoGo response
All conditions feature the same amount of trials, i.e. Go/NoGo and Win/Avoid are fully orthogonalized (unlike other go/nogo tasks that are aimed at measuring inhibition and thus feature more go trials).

The correct response (Go/NoGo) is not instructed, but has been learned by trial-and-error from feedback.
Cue valence (Win/Avoid) is either instructed (e.g. cue edges in certain color) or has to be inferred from feedback (only Win cues can yield winning money, only Avoid cues can yield losing money).
Outcomes are usually probabilistic (e.g. 80% valid feedback, i.e. correct responses lead to winning money for Win cues/ neutral outcomes for Avoid cues in only 80% of trials, otherwise to invalid feedback; reversed probabilities for incorrect responses).

The task is used to measure Pavlovian biases/ motivational biases, i.e. the tendency to show more Go responses (and faster reaction times) to Win cues than Avoid cues.


## Go-noGo task - current study

     Participants are looking gems on the screen and they need to decide whether they should:
      - press to Win (GW)
      - press to Avoid losing (GAL) = incogruent
      - not press to Win (NGW) = incongruent
      - not press to avoid losing (NGL)
      

      
### PILOT GNG 
     
     Full tasks consists of 400 trials split into 4 blocks each.
     
     Each block (100 trials) has 4 different gems (Cues) that correspond to one condition; GW, GAL, NGW, NGL. 
     
     Each gem is presented 25 times per block.
     
     Sum:
     4 gems per block (presented 25 times each, per block)
     1 block = 100 trials
     4 blocks = 400 trials

### ACTUAL GNG 

     Full tasks consists of 320 trials split into 4 blocks each.
     
     Each block (80 trials) has 4 different gems (Cues) that correspond to one condition; GW, GAL, NGW, NGL. 
     
     Each gem is presented 20 times per block.
     
     Sum:
     4 gems per block (presented 20 times each, per block)
     1 block = 80 trials
     4 blocks = 320 trials

*Both PILOT and ACTUAL GNG task are probabilistic; that is 80% valid feedback, i.e. correct responses lead to winning money for Win cues and neutral outcomes for Avoid cues in only 80% of trials, 
otherwise to invalid feedback; reversed probabilities for incorrect responses.*
