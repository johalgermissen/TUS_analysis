     Go-noGo task
     
     Participants are looking gems on the screen and they need to decide whether they should:
      - press to Win (GW)
      - press to Avoid losing (GAL) = incogruent
      - not press to Win (NGW) = incongruent
      - not press to avoid losing (NGL)
      
      
     Full tasks consists of 400 trials split into 4 blocks each.
     
     Each block (100 trials) has 4 different gems.
     
     Each gem is presented 25 times per block.
     
     Sum:
     4 gems per block (presented 25 times each, per block)
     1 block = 100 trials
     4 blocks = 400 trials
